  hero__title: Hi! üëã 
  hero__description: >
    I'm <strong>Johannes M. Schleicher</strong> ‚Äì engineer by training, builder by nature, and entrepreneur by conviction. Over the past two decades, I've designed and scaled intelligent software systems across a wide range of domains ‚Äì from distributed energy infrastructure to smart cities, from AI in healthcare and sports to cloud platforms powering ‚Ç¨100M+ in revenue.<br><br>
    I'm the ‚ù§Ô∏è and co-founder of <a href="https://www.jademind.com">JadeMind GmbH</a>, a lean, independent and profitable software company I've been running with my friend <a href="https://www.katzian.net">Andreas</a> for over 14 years. Together, we help organizations solve complex problems ‚Äî simply, fast, and effectively. No bullshit. Just deep tech, clear minds, and focused execution. We do what we love, focus on the essence, and strive for real outcomes.<br><br>
    I've served as CIO and tech lead at <a href="https://www.neoom.com">neoom AG</a>, Austria's leading cleantech company. I helped scale the company from 19 to nearly 300 employees while building a platform that now powers thousands of energy sites across Europe and substantially contributed to ‚Ç¨100 million in revenue.<br><br>
    I hold a Ph.D. in Distributed Systems from TU Vienna, where I focused on smart city application ecosystems and received the Austrian Award of Excellence for my dissertation. My <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1VGMIxwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">research</a> has been published in leading journals and cited over 600 times. In 2022, I had the opportunity to share my thoughts on human-centered innovation in a TEDx talk titled <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/johannes_m_schleicher_small_changes_big_johannes_m_schleicher_tedxtuwien">"Small Changes, Big"</a><br><br>
    Along the way, I've learned that what matters most isn't just what we build ‚Äì but how and why we build it. I'm passionate about creating tools and systems that support clarity, calm, and better ways of living and working ‚Äì as a founder, a father of two, and a human being navigating a complex world.<br><br>
    On <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jomisjm">Twitter</a> and our <a href="https://www.mentalflares.com">blog</a>, I share actionable insights on technology, entrepreneurship, health, and intentional living.<br><br>
